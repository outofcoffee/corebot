# Corebot: A Slack bot for Rundeck and Jenkins

Trigger your [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org) or [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) jobs from [Slack](https://slack.com).

_Example:_

    @corebot deploy user-service 1.0 to staging
    
    > corebot:
    > OK, I'm deploying user-service version 1.0 to staging.
    > Status of job is: running
    > Details: http://rundeck/jobs/abc/123
    
> Why would you want this? Check out [ChatOps](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/01/what-is-chatops-adoption-guide/).

## Instructions

* As a Slack admin, create a Slack bot user and obtain its access token - [instructions](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot)
* As a Rundeck admin, generate a Rundeck API token - [instructions](http://rundeck.org/2.6.9/api/index.html#token-authentication)
* Set environment variables
* Run!

## Quick start

The quickest way to get up and running is to use the Docker image:

    docker run -d \
            --env SLACK_AUTH_TOKEN="CHANGEME" \
            --env SLACK_CHANNELS="corebot" \
            --env RUNDECK_API_TOKEN="CHANGEME" \
            --env RUNDECK_BASE_URL="http://rundeck:4440" \
            -v /path/to/actions.yml:/opt/corebot/actions.yml \
            outofcoffee/corebot

> Note: the container does not require any inbound ports to be exposed.

> Note: See the _Environment variables_ section for the available configuration settings.

## Build

If instead you wish to build and run locally, you can run:

    ./gradlew installDist
    docker-compose build

Once built, set the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`. See the _Environment variables_ section.

Then run with:

    docker-compose up

If you change anything, don't forget to rebuild before running again.

## Environment variables

Configure the bot using the following environment variables.

### Common variables

    SLACK_AUTH_TOKEN="CHANGEME"
    SLACK_CHANNELS="corebot"
    ACTION_CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/actions.yaml"
    
> Note: `SLACK_CHANNELS` is a comma-separated list of channel names, such as `"channelA,channelB"`

> Note: the default path for `ACTION_CONFIG_FILE` is `/opt/corebot/actions.yml`. When using corebot within a Docker container, it is typical to add your configuration file at this location, or bind-mount a file to this path.

### Variables for Rundeck

    RUNDECK_API_TOKEN="CHANGEME"
    RUNDECK_BASE_URL="http://rundeck:4440"

> Note: ensure that the API token you generate in Rundeck has the necessary permissions to trigger builds. For more information, consult the Rundeck ACL documentation.

### Variables for Jenkins

    JENKINS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
    JENKINS_USERNAME="CHANGEME"
    JENKINS_PASSWORD="CHANGEME"
    JENKINS_API_TOKEN="CHANGEME"
    
> Note: typically you will specify the username and password for accessing a Jenkins instance. The token approach is rarely used and can be omitted.

### Tuning variables

Advanced variables to tune performance:

    CACHE_EXPIRY="60"

The cache expiry controls the period of time, in seconds, corebot holds the action configuration in memory after reading it from file.

    EXECUTION_STATUS_TIMEOUT="120"

The execution status timeout controls the period of time, in seconds, corebot will poll a running job for status updates, after which it gives up.

## Actions

Corebot has both built-in actions and custom actions. Examples of built in actions are the lock/unlock actions. Custom actions are triggers for your Rundeck/Jenkins jobs, configured using a configuration file, typically called `actions.yml`.

### Action configuration file

> Note: the configuration file path is specified with the `ACTION_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

_Example file:_
```
version: '1'
actions:
  services:
    jobId: 9374f1c8-7b3f-4145-8556-6b55551fb60f
    template: deploy services {version} to {environment}
```

File structure:

* All files must specify version ‘1’
* All actions must sit under a top level `actions` block
* Each action must have a name (it’s `services` in this example)
* Each action must have either:
  * a Rundeck job ID (obtain this from Rundeck), or
  * a Jenkins job name
* Each action must have a template - more details below
* Each action may optionally specify a list of tags
* Each action may optionally specify option configuration, such as:
  * static values
  * value transformers
  * whether the option can be locked
  
> Tip: Check out the `examples/config` directory for sample configuration files.

#### Action driver

Actions should specify a driver. The available drivers are:

* rundeck
* jenkins

> Note: if none is specified, the driver is assumed to be `rundeck`.

_Example:_
```
version: '1'
actions:
  services:
    driver: jenkins
    jobId: my-jenkins-job
    template: deploy web {version} to {environment}
```

**Important:** Ensure that you set the environment variables corresponding to the driver(s) you use, such as the base URL, API key/username etc.

#### Action template

An action template provides the syntax for invoking the command. 

_Example:_

	deploy services

A template also allows you to specify job options as placeholders, such as:

	deploy services {version} to {environment}

In this example both _version_ and _environment_ are captured from the command, such as:

	@corebot deploy services 1.0 to UAT

This will result in the action being fired, passing the following options:

- version=1.0
- environment=UAT

#### Static option values

You might want to pass an option value to a job every time, and not require the user to provide it. You can accomplish this using the `value` property of an option within the `options` action block:

```
version: '1'
actions:
  services:
    jobId: 9374f1c8-7b3f-4145-8556-6b55551fb60f
    template: deploy services {version} to {environment}
    options:
      myOption:
        value: someValue
      myOtherOption:
        value: someOtherValue
```

This will result in the action being fired, passing the following options:

- version=1.0
- environment=UAT
- _myOption=someValue_
- _myOtherOption=someOtherValue_

#### Transforming options

You might want to transform an option value provided by a user before it is passed to a job. You can accomplish this using the `transformers` section of an option within the `options` action block:

```
version: '1'
actions:
  services:
    jobId: 9374f1c8-7b3f-4145-8556-6b55551fb60f
    template: deploy services {version} to {environment}
    options:
      version:
        transformers:
          - LOWERCASE
      environment:
        transformers:
          - UPPERCASE
```

If the user typed this command:

    @corebot deploy services V1.0 to uat

This will result in the action being fired, passing the following options:

- version=v1.0 (note: lowercased)
- environment=UAT (note: uppercased)

#### Locking options

You might want to lock an option value, so that it cannot be passed to an action.

> Example: If you have an option to specify the environment for a deployment, you might wish to lock deployments to the environment named 'production'.

You can accomplish this using the `lockable` property of an option within the `options` action block:

```
version: '1'
actions:
  services:
    jobId: 9374f1c8-7b3f-4145-8556-6b55551fb60f
    template: deploy services {version} to {environment}
    options:
      environment:
        lockable: true
```

If the user typed this command:

    @corebot lock environment prod

This will result in a lock being placed on the 'environment' option, with the value 'prod'.

With the lock applied, this will fail:

    @corebot deploy services 1.0 to prod
    
...but this will still succeed:

    @corebot deploy services 1.0 to uat
    
You can of course unlock the option with:

    @corebot unlock environment prod
    
> Note: It's strongly advisable to apply a _transformer_ to lockable options, to ensure the value 'prod' is considered equivalent to 'PROD'.

#### Tags and multiple job actions

Sometimes actions can be run on multiple jobs. To do this, set the `tags` block:

```
version: '1'
actions:
  deploy-services:
    jobId: 9374f1c8-7b3f-4145-8556-6b55551fb60f
    template: deploy services {version} to {environment}
    tags:
	  - services
	    
  restart-services:
    jobId: e9d12eec-abff-4780-89cd-56a48b8c67be
    template: restart services in {environment}
    tags:
	  - services
```

Here, two actions are defined: `deploy-services` and `restart-services`, both tagged with `services`. This means you can do things like:

	@corebot lock services

…and both actions will be locked.

> Tip: There is a special tag set on all actions, named 'all'. This means you can do things like `@corebot lock all`.

#### Customised output

Sometimes the bots reaction is enough to see the status. To do this, set the `showJobOutcome` option to `false`. Default is `true`.
 
Sometimes the output of the job is needed to be given back by the bot. To do this, set the `showJobOutput` option to `true`. Default is `false`.

```
version: '1'
actions:
  deploy-services:
    jobId: 9374f1c8-7b3f-4145-8556-6b55551fb60f
    template: deploy services {version} to {environment}
    showJobOutput: true
    showJobOutcome: false    
```

#### Security

You can choose which users are authorised to perform actions, using the `security` block:

```
security:
  users:
    # alice uses the built-in 'admin' role
    alice:
      roles:
        - admin
```
> *Important:* if you do not specify a security configuration explicitly, the default will be used. The default settings permit all users to perform all actions.

There is a built in role, named `admin`, which you can assign to users. You can also define your own roles, listing the permissions granted to users with that role.

You can assign roles on a per-username basis or, if you wish to assign certain roles to all users, use the special `"*"` key, as shown in the example below:

```
security:
  roles:
    # a role that can only trigger jobs
    deployer:
      permissions:
        - trigger

  users:
    # alice uses the built-in 'admin' role
    alice:
      roles:
        - admin

    # all users can trigger jobs
    "*":
      roles:
        - deployer
```

By default, role definitions apply to all actions. If you wish to restrict the permissions granted by a role to certain actions only, add a tag to the action and also to the corresponding `tags` array in the role:
 
```
security:
  roles:
    # a role that can only trigger jobs
    deployer:
      permissions:
        - trigger
    
    # this role only permits triggering of actions tagged with 'services'
      tags:
        - services
```

### Built-in actions

There are a number of built in actions, such as:

* `@corebot help` - show usage information.
* `@corebot lock {action or tag name}` - lock action(s) to prevent them being triggered accidentally.
* `@corebot lock {option name} {option value}` - lock an option with a given value.
* `@corebot unlock {action or tag name}` - unlock locked action(s).
* `@corebot unlock {option name} {option value}` - lock an option with a given value.
* `@corebot status {action or tag name}` - show status of action(s).
* `@corebot enable {action or tag name}` - set the Rundeck execution status for a job - *Note:* this requires the Rundeck ACL to permit the API user to set the execution status of a job.
* `@corebot disable {action or tag name}` - set the Rundeck execution status for a job - *Note:* this requires the Rundeck ACL to permit the API user to set the execution status of a job.

### Rundeck

Any Rundeck instance can be used as long as it supports API v14 or higher.

As an example, here is an unofficial Rundeck Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/jordan/rundeck/

    docker run -it \
        -p 4440:4440 \
        -e SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4440 \
        jordan/rundeck
        
### Jenkins

A modern version (1.7+) of Jenkins is required - version 2.x or higher is preferred.

Here is the official Jenkins Docker image:

    docker run -it \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        jenkins

### Maven dependencies

To use the dependencies in a project, add the repository:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/gatehillsoftware-maven/snapshots/'
    }
    
    // jitpack required for Slack dependency
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

...then add a dependency:

```
compile "com.gatehill.corebot:core:0.6.3-SNAPSHOT"
```

#### Publishing

Dependencies can be published to the project Maven repository.

> Note: Publishing to the repository requires appropriate AWS keys to be set in `gradle.properties`.
